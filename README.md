# Wildfire danger optimization using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning

This is the code for every implementation for the paper: *Wildfire danger prediction optimization using deep learning*.
We used Transfer Learning to create accurate CNN models to detect if a forest has been destroyed by a wildfire or not to help the already existing FWI prediction.
We also created some Regression models trained on Greek Wildfires in 2018.We showed that there's a very low correlation between the meteorological data and the destroyed area,thus,almost every wildfire in Greece is because of human hands.

# Tensorflow Pretrained CNN models

We used:
* Xception
* ResNet50
* VGG16
* VGG19
* ResNetV2
* EfficientNetV2L
* EfficientNetB7
* Some Custom CNN's based on the best results from above.
